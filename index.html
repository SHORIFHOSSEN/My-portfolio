      adults. With its vibrant visuals, funny characters, and simple storyline,
      it’s perfect for a family movie night.

      Although “Iron Man” is not a cartoon, it’s an excellent superhero film
      that appeals to both adults and older children. With action-packed scenes
      and a charismatic lead, it’s a fan favorite in the Marvel universe.
